I've built a webiste called "Ravenous", a Yelp-like clone (https://www.yelp.com)
that can search the Yelp API for restaurants that match a search option!

I used the React library and built several components, queried the Yelp API, and more to achieve a functioning Yelp-like clone.

Note: the Yelp API does not handle properly CORS. To solve it, the queries to it can be proxied via another backend API that would handle it better. The project is using the backend API provided by Codecademy. When trying to run the project locally, one should first activate a temporary access to this proxy API on the following URL: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo

To run this project please run the following command: npm start
